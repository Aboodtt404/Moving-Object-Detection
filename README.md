Moving Object Detection in Videos (Traffic Monitoring)

This Python script implements a real-time moving object detection system suitable for basic traffic monitoring applications. It leverages OpenCV and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for background subtraction.

Features

    Real-time Processing: Analyzes video frames on-the-fly for real-time object detection.
    Background Subtraction with GMM: Adapts to gradual lighting changes and handles static objects in the scene.
    Morphological Closing: Refines the foreground mask by removing noise and holes.
    Learning Rate Update: Continuously updates the background model to account for slow scene changes.
    Output: Generates a video output where only moving objects are highlighted within the original video frame (black background with detected objects shown in original colors).

Applications

    Basic traffic monitoring: Detecting moving vehicles in a scene.
    People counting: Identifying and counting people entering or leaving a specific area.

Limitations

    This approach might not be ideal for complex scenarios with:
        Significant background variations (e.g., flickering lights, shadows)
        Slow-moving objects
        Multiple object types requiring individual classification

# Moving Object Detection in Videos (Traffic Monitoring)

This Python script implements a real-time moving object detection system suitable for basic traffic monitoring applications. It leverages OpenCV and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for background subtraction.

## Features

- **Real-time Processing:** Analyzes video frames on-the-fly for real-time object detection. (#real-time)
- **Background Subtraction with GMM:** Adapts to gradual lighting changes and handles static objects in the scene. (#background-subtraction #GMM)
- **Morphological Closing:** Refines the foreground mask by removing noise and holes. (#morphological-closing)
- **Learning Rate Update:** Continuously updates the background model to account for slow scene changes. (#learning-rate)
- **Output:** Generates a video output where only moving objects are highlighted within the original video frame (black background with detected objects shown in original colors). (#video-output)

## Applications

- **Basic traffic monitoring:** Detecting moving vehicles in a scene. (#traffic-monitoring)
- **People counting:** Identifying and counting people entering or leaving a specific area. (#people-counting)

## Limitations

This approach might not be ideal for complex scenarios with:
- Significant background variations (e.g., flickering lights, shadows)
- Slow-moving objects
- Multiple object types requiring individual classification

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/moving-object-detection.git
    ```
    Use code with caution.

2. **Install dependencies:**

    This script requires OpenCV and scikit-learn. You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python scikit-learn
    ```
    Use code with caution.

3. **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py path/to/your/video.mp4
    ```
    Replace `path/to/your/video.mp4` with the actual path to your video file.
    Use code with caution.

## Further Enhancements

- Explore optical flow or advanced background modeling algorithms for more robust and complex applications. (#optical-flow #background-modeling)
